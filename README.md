This is our project for the EMCP hackathon. It was made with python. 
Our initial goal was to have the car move as is calculated the fuel consumption and emissions, then it would tell you how much fumes could have been avoided by biking, walking, or taking the bus, but due to the time limit and many errors, that goal was not completely reached.
